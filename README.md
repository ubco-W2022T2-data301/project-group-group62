For this Data, as it is the airbnb data analysis in Hong Kong. We hope that our research and analysis can help companies, organizations, and people who want to or are already in Hong Kong to understand the concept of pricing in Hong Kong. And what is the average customer demand for a house. Our data will give third parties a better understanding of the market demand so they can improve their marketing strategies.

We are also interested in this data set because the price of housing is increasing due to the growing population. We want to understand how landlords and other sellers are pricing their homes. Airbnb is also one of the most popular software in the world, which allows us to collect more accurate data.

We can make a user facing dashboard for our data and we can use line graphs to analyze the pricing difference, bar graphs to identify the demand of amenities, and pie graphs to analyze the percentage of where most housing locate.x
